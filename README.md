# WordNet31_japanese_translation_base
Our translation is based on this patched Prinston WordNet 3.1.  We have fixed gliches in def and links. 

## What is this?

###successor
We have seen the fixes patched into WordNet3.1 and knew that WordNet is still living. These fixes helpd
our translation a lot, but unfortunately, we find there are still more to fix.  
We are thinking of ourseleves as a successor of 3.1 efforts. 

###base text for the translation
Once we were bothering for our footnotes for each problems. They became longer and longer and began to 
cover our works. So we decided that we should patch the original, make it public with our comments, resasons and refered books or URLs that is the basis of the patch.
.... and blablablah
